- **Frontend**: Next.js application with wallet integration
- **Card Issuing**: Stripe Issuing integration for virtual card provisioning
- **Risk Engine**: Real-time health factor calculations and liquidation monitoring
- **Points System**: Rewards for spending, participation, and referrals
- **Database Stack**: PostgreSQL + Redis for <500ms auth responses

### Week 1 Focus
- [x] Anchor program skeleton with basic account structures
- [x] Complete smart contract implementation
- [x] Architecture documentation and design decisions
- [x] Database schema implementation
- [x] Stripe webhook handler for authorization/capture events
- [x] Authorization service with health factor checks
- [ ] KYC integration (Sumsub/Veriff) for user onboarding
- [ ] Blockchain indexer service
- [ ] Redis cache layer setup

### Technical Specifications
- Collateral: jitoSOL only (MVP)
- Max LTV: 50%
- Liquidation Threshold: 60%
- Liquidation Bonus: 6%
- APR: 12% (flat rate)
- Authorization Response Time: <500ms target
- Points System: 1 point per $1 spent (base rate)

### Architecture Decisions
- **Custom Anchor Program**: Built specifically for credit card use case vs. using existing lending protocols
