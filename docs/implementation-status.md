  - Users, positions, cards, transactions
  - Monthly partitioning for scalability
  - Points system tables
  - Audit logging for compliance
- **Optimised for Performance**:
  - Strategic indexes for <10ms queries
  - Materialized views for analytics
  - Update triggers for cache invalidation

### 3. Stripe Integration (Critical Path)
- **Webhook Handler**: Processes auth requests in <500ms
